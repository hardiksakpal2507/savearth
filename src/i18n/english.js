    [k.SPACETEXT]:
      "As the exploration and use of space progress, so does the amount of man-made space debris. At the moment, there are already more than <strong>6 tons of garbage</strong> over the earth's atmosphere.<br><br> The problem with this is the speed of the single particles, causing even the smallest of objects to have a <strong>devastating impact</strong> on, for example, a satellite. <br><br> Besides, a collision could cause a <strong>chain reaction</strong>, resulting in a large number of continuing collisions.",
    [k.OZONETITLE]: "Ozone",
    [k.OZONETEXT]:
      "The ozone layer in the stratosphere ensures that a large part of the <strong>ultraviolet solar radiation</strong> is absorbed and has only indirectly to do with climate change, even if these terms are often used together.<br><br> The first ozone hole was <strong>discovered in 1960</strong> over the Antarctic. Also over Australia and New Zealand is an ozone hole, which leads to high susceptibility to diseases such as skin cancer.<br><br> As a countermeasure, the <strong>CFC ban was introduced in 1987.</strong> According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization, there is a chance that the ozone layer will largely recover by 2050.",
    [k.MOUNTAINSTITLE]: "Mountains",
    [k.MOUNTAINSTEXT]: "Unfortunately, the consequences of climate change are also clearly visible in the mountains. These lead to <strong>global glacial melting,</strong> which manifests itself in landslides and downhills.<br><br> After the melt, only barren rock deserts remain, which <strong>makes life impossible</strong> for many small animals and plants in these areas.<br><br> Since 2000, glaciers have lost an average of <strong>3&nbsp%</strong> of their volume each year. In the Alps alone, according to calculations, the number of glaciers could halve in the next few years.<br><br> This phenomenon is also a source of <strong>water scarcity</strong> in these regions, bringing with it further problems.",
    [k.AIRTITLE]: "Air",
    [k.AIRTEXT]: "Currently, air traffic contributes about <strong>3&nbsp%</strong> of global CO2 emissions. On the one hand, this does not sound like much, but on the other hand, it has to be taken into account that aircraft are numerically far inferior to the other transport routes.<br><br> Flying is a <strong>very inefficient</strong> mean of transport and therefore causes a rapid increase in emissions as the number increases. A disturbing development is thus the domestic flights, which are often used due to comfort or time pressure.",
    [k.POLLUTIONTITLE]: "Pollution",
    [k.POLLUTIONTEXT]: "Another man-made problem deals with air pollution in cities. In the long term, this poses a threatening health risk for those affected and <strong>can lead to various cancers.</strong><br><br> About <strong>7 million deaths a year</strong> are said to be due to it. As a countermeasure serves the Paris Agreement, which serves as an alliance to keep global warming at a low level. Unfortunately, this alone is not enough.",

    [k.ICETITLE]: "Ice",
    [k.ICETEXT]: "As a result of climate change, the ice of the polar regions also melts and leads to rising sea levels. It is also disturbing that the speed of the ice melt is <strong>constantly increasing.</strong><br><br> According to the calculations of a research group of the University of Colorado, the sea level could have risen by over <strong>65 centimeters by the year 2100.</strong><br><br> This can lead to <strong>worldwide flood disasters</strong> and low-lying regions could be completely flooded. Particularly affected are flat island groups of the tropics, such as the island state of Maldives, for example.",
    [k.PLASTICTITLE]: "Plastic",
    [k.PLASTICTEXT]: "In total, about <strong>150 million tons</strong> of plastic waste are floating in the sea. Every year, up to 12 million tons are added with an upward trend.<br><br> Thus, by the year 2050, there could be <strong>more plastic than fish</strong> in the sea. Many animals become entangled in plastic or confuse small particles with food.<br><br> The consequences are strangulation, injuries, and plastic-filled stomachs. The last one leads to <strong>starving animals</strong> with a full stomach in the long term.",
    [k.CORALTITLE]: "Coral",
    [k.CORALTEXT]: "As corals live in symbiosis with algae, heat waves cause the corals to repel these and bleach themselves. The so-called coral bleaching can lead to the <strong>death of the coral</strong> within a few days.<br><br> In the period from 2014 to 2017 alone, almost <strong>one-third</strong> of all coral reefs existing worldwide were attacked by coral bleaching. In the long term, this could also threaten the livelihoods of many people who make their living from fishing.",

This threatens the food and habitat of the animals since bamboos only flourish and multiply every 15 to 120 years, so the plant can hardly adapt to such rapid changes.",
